Humans being replaced with newer technologies is not a new phenonemon. It is estimated that certain jobs began being phased out with the invention of wheel. There are even records in Ancient Egypt of new farming and masonry techniques replacing certain job fields. Rome had this problem, England and France had this problem in the middle ages (notably with the invention of knitting machine) to the printing press, to examples starting with the Industrial Revolution, with newer technologies such as cars, refridgeration, and more. The list goes on,

Jumping forward, in the digital age, there is a rapid increase in jobs being replaced by machines, notably with automation and Artificial Intelligence. This document covers jobs that have been/are currently being replaced by newer technologies.

Jobs have never been stable. There has never been a job that is completely guaranteed to last a lfetime. As a wise Greek Philosopher (Heraclitus of Ephesus) [may have](#WikiQuote) once said: **The only constant is change.** The way to go forward is to adapt and change.
